				TeamKART is a group of students from IIT Kharagpur who like to explore the practical side of automotive engineering. We design, manufacture and test Formula style race cars and represent IIT Kharagpur in Formula SAE competitions in the national and international levels. Officially, we are a sponsored research project under the Sponsored Research and Industrial consultancy Cell (SRIC) and the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Kharagpur.

				Formula Student (FS) is the world's most established educational motorsport competition. Run by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE), universities from across the globe are challenged to design and build a single-seat racing car in order to compete in static and dynamic events, which demonstrate their engineering expertise and test the performance of the vehicle.
